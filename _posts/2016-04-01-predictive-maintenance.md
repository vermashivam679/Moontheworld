### Overview  
- A UK based public transportation company was interested in predicting the failure of its 8 vehicle components.
- We developed Survival Analysis models for each component to predict their probability of failure in the next 4 weeks and optimized preventive & reactive treatment costs


### Project Details:  
- I stratified the data by fleet between train, validation & test datasets and evaluated the performance of models based on ROC curves & AUC on test & validation data  
- Used Cox-proportional hazard modeling for predicting probability of failure in next N(upto 8) weeks for 8 main vehicle components
- Optimized time varying probability cut-offs by minimizing net maintenance cost (~10%) using Genetic Algorithm
