### Overview
- This forecasting project tries to build a model to predict the number of passengers that will book a travel ticket in the remaining days to departure of a flight.  
- The models were trained on the last 3 years worth of travel for a booking window of 90 days to departure.
- Every route has a separate model based on its history (New routes take the history of a similar route as proxy).
- The forecast period is for future 90 departure dates for a network of around 1400 daily flights.
- Captured the impact of capacity changes, competition flight positioning, seasonality, current booked position, Net Days Out (NDO), holidays & breaks on demand forecasting.
- The models took 8 times the current runtime to train & predict, had higher complexity, lesser interpretability & worked better than simple additive pickup model only on 70% of the network.
