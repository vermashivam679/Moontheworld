### Overview  
Using this project I tried to solve for the following challenges:  
- We needed a more scientific financial reporting system to show accurate load factor forecasts for *Annual Operations Planning (AOP)*.  
- Forecasting was done only for \\(120\\) days of departure outside which inventory was managed with a more aggressive strategy leading to lesser bookings.  
- The forecasting method didn't include the impact of holidays & festivals which was only captured in the current booked position.  

### Details  
- Indian festivals are not equally popular in every region. But public holidays, summer & winter breaks have a similar travel pattern across the country.  
- Analyzing the holidays we created a pool of important holidays & breaks to segment them into broad categories including Religious holidays, weekend holidays, Special festivals like Diwali/Holi, etc.  
- Identified the behavior of holidays with respect to Day of Week & Month of Year and coded that into the variables.  
- Assessed the performance of various models like ARIMAX, exponential smoothing methods and Bayesian structural time series modeling to finalize linear regression, because of its intelligibility and competent accuracy.
