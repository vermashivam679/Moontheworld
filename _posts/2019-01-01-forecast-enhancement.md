### Overview  

- Incorporated pricing data to forecast class-fare of class-level demand forecast to also give demand curve for the flight to depart.  
- The [fare adjustment algorithm](https://vermashivam679.github.io/Moontheworld/fare-realignment/) changed the new forecast to adjust according to the fare structure decided by the market analyst.  
- This enhancement linked pricing strategy and inventory allocation for effective Revenue Management.  
- Improved the runtime of forecasting methodology from \\(8\\)hrs to \\(4\\)hrs (\\(50\%\\) reduction) using double the historical data and with class-fares for fare adjustment.  


### Project Details:  

#### Forecasting Price with demand:  
- Initially, there was no database of class-fares being offered. Using historically saved `R` images of [RMNext](https://vermashivam679.github.io/Moontheworld/RMNext/) runs, I extracted the latest captured fares for a historical flight.  
- Setup an automated process for capturing fares from RMNext offered within \\(7\\) days to departure of a flight in the fare database.  
- Using flight-level demand curve the fare adjustment algorithm could adjust the forecasted demand using new fares offered in the market.  

#### Increasing Efficiency of Forecasting Algorithm:  
- Mentored a junior team member to work on shifting the forecasting process from `SQL` to `R` to reduce manual intervention, use more historical data, increase efficiency & dynamicity of the model.  
- Used `data.table` framework in `R`, vectorized the code and divided the process in \\(2\\) equal batches to run in parallel.  
- This increased the flexibility for a market analyst to choose more and appropriate historical data for forecasting market demand.
