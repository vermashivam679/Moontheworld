title: "Fare Restructuring & Forecast Fare Adjustment Algorithm"
date: 2013-05-22

### Fare Restructuring  <kbd>[6E Achiever](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vermashivam679/Moontheworld/master/assets/img/Fare_restructuring_6e_achiever.jpg)</kbd>
- Using Historical data estimated market level demand curve using Monotone Spline Interpolation.
- Maximized revenue by optimizing fares on demand curve using shortest path algorithm. The fare values considered for optimization were market competition's fares scrapped from the web.
- The optimal fares were given as a suggestion to the market operations team.
- Estimated impact of fare restructuring on revenue to be 1-2% and quick reaction to competition’s fare action.


### Forecast Fare Adjustmet  
- Due to fare restructuring the fares of fare-buckets changed drastically, therefore class-level forecast was not in-line with the fares.
- To capture this impact we created a demand curve of the forecasted demand and using route-level constant historical fare structure.
- Using the demand curve we could forecast demand for new fare structures given by the market analyst.




Here are some examples of what a post with images might look like. If you want to display two or three images next to each other responsively use `figure` with the appropriate `class`. Each instance of `figure` is auto-numbered and displayed in the caption.

### Figures (for images or video)

#### One Up

<figure>
	<a href="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8426/7758832526_cc8f681e48_b.jpg"><img src="http://farm9.staticflickr.com/8426/7758832526_cc8f681e48_c.jpg"></a>
	<figcaption><a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/80901381@N04/7758832526/" title="Morning Fog Emerging From Trees by A Guy Taking Pictures, on Flickr">Morning Fog Emerging From Trees by A Guy Taking Pictures, on Flickr</a>.</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Two Up

Apply the `half` class like so to display two images side by side that share the same caption.

{% highlight html %}
<figure class="half">
    <a href="/images/image-filename-1-large.jpg"><img src="/images/image-filename-1.jpg"></a>
    <a href="/images/image-filename-2-large.jpg"><img src="/images/image-filename-2.jpg"></a>
    <figcaption>Caption describing these two images.</figcaption>
</figure>
{% endhighlight %}

And you'll get something that looks like this:

<figure class="half">
	<a href="http://placehold.it/1200x600.JPG"><img src="http://placehold.it/600x300.jpg"></a>
	<a href="http://placehold.it/1200x600.jpeg"><img src="http://placehold.it/600x300.jpg"></a>
	<figcaption>Two images.</figcaption>
</figure>

#### Three Up

Apply the `third` class like so to display three images side by side that share the same caption.

{% highlight html %}
<figure class="third">
	<img src="/images/image-filename-1.jpg">
	<img src="/images/image-filename-2.jpg">
	<img src="/images/image-filename-3.jpg">
	<figcaption>Caption describing these three images.</figcaption>
</figure>
{% endhighlight %}

And you'll get something that looks like this:

<figure class="third">
	<img src="http://placehold.it/600x300.jpg">
	<img src="http://placehold.it/600x300.jpg">
	<img src="http://placehold.it/600x300.jpg">
	<figcaption>Three images.</figcaption>
</figure>

### Alternative way

Another way to achieve the same result is to include `gallery` Liquid template. In this case you
don't have to write any HTML tags – just copy a small block of code, adjust the parameters (see below)
and fill the block with any number of links to images. You can mix relative and external links.

Here is the block you might want to use:

{% highlight liquid %}
{% raw %}
{% capture images %}
	http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/naruto/images/9/97/Hinata.png
	http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/naruto/images/7/79/Hinata_Part_II.png
	http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/naruto/images/1/15/J%C5%ABho_S%C5%8Dshiken.png
{% endcapture %}
{% include gallery images=images caption="Test images" cols=3 %}
{% endraw %}
{% endhighlight %}

Parameters:

- `caption`: Sets the caption under the gallery (see `figcaption` HTML tag above);
- `cols`: Sets the number of columns of the gallery.
Available values: [1..3].

It will look something like this:

{% capture images %}
	http://vignette2.wikia.nocookie.net/naruto/images/9/97/Hinata.png
	http://vignette4.wikia.nocookie.net/naruto/images/7/79/Hinata_Part_II.png
	http://vignette1.wikia.nocookie.net/naruto/images/1/15/J%C5%ABho_S%C5%8Dshiken.png
{% endcapture %}
{% include gallery images=images caption="Test images" cols=3 %}
