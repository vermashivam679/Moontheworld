### Overview  
- Revenue management (RM) is the application of data and analytics aimed at defining how to sell a product(ex- Seat ticket) to the right customers(ex- Passenger), at a right price(ex- fare bucket) at the right time(ex- Net Days Out) and using the right channel(ex- own website).  
- Inventory Allocation is deciding how many seats to sell in each fare bucket for a flight to depart in future. Load pickup forecast is one input to this model.  
- At IndiGo, I front led the development of an in-house Inventory Optimization System that incorporated a forecasting model, an optimization model, and a strategic decision tree to match competition in the market which none other Indian carrier had done before.  

### Project Details:  

- Developed inventory optimization process using EMSR-b algorithm for ($$1400$$ daily flights & $$365$$ days)  
- Planned & setup automated process integrating various data sources with in-built alerts using `R` & `SQL`  
- The system was dynamic & interactive and took inputs from more than $$50$$ revenue analysts for efficient business operations.  
- I collaborated with the market operations team and made them comfortable with the new system in place.  
- My diligence in the project yielded great rewards when I was awarded [High Business Impact](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vermashivam679/Moontheworld/master/assets/img/6e_High_Business_Impact.jpg) & [6e Achiever](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/vermashivam679/Moontheworld/master/assets/img/RMNext_6e_achiever.jpg). I was also among $$18$$ finalists for the “Employee of the Year” award out of $$14,000$$ employees.  
- This led to Q-o-Q $$5-7\%$$ improvement in `RASK` (Revenue/Available Seat KMs) and expected Y-o-Y improvement of approximately $$5\%$$. 'Expected' because it is difficult to estimate this due to continous capacity increase, different market dynamics & continous enhancements in the algorithm.

> The whole experience gave me a good exposure to learn how to initiate & formulate something new that reflected my idiosyncratic way of thought.
