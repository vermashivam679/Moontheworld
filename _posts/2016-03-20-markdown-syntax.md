### Overview  
- Revenue management (RM) is the application of data and analytics aimed at defining how to sell a product(ex- Seat ticket) to the right customers(ex- Passenger), at a right price(ex- fare bucket) at the right time(ex- Net Days Out) and using the right channel(ex- own website).  
- Inventory (seats in the plane) Allocation is deciding how many seats to sell in each fare bucket for a flight to depart in future. Load pickup forecast is one input to this model.  
- At IndiGo, I front led the development of an in-house Inventory Optimization System that incorporated a forecasting model, an optimization model, and a strategic decision tree to match competition in the market which none other Indian carrier had done before.  

### Project Details:  

- Developed inventory optimization process using EMSR-b algorithm for (~1400 daily flights & 365 days)  
- Planned & setup automated process integrating various data sources with in-built alerts using R & SQL  
- The system was dynamic & interactive and took inputs from more than 50 revenue analysts for efficient business operations.  
- I collaborated with the market operations team and made them comfortable with the new system in place.  
- My diligence in the project yielded great rewards when I was awarded “High Business Impact” & “6e Achiever”. I was also among 18 finalists for the “Employee of the Year” award out of 14,000 employees.  
- This led to Q-o-Q 5-7% improvement in RASK (Revenue/Available Seat KMs) and expected Y-o-Y improvement of ~5%. 'Expected' because it is difficult to estimate this due to continous capacity increase, different market dynamics & continous enhancements in the algorithm.  

> The whole experience gave me a good exposure to learn how to initiate & formulate something new that reflected my idiosyncratic way of thought.
