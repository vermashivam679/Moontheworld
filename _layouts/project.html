                                <li>This was an attempt to replace the whole forecasting methodology with machine learning based modeling and integrate it with the Inventory Allocation system</li>
                                <li>It couldn't go into production because of 7 times higher training time, high complexity, less interpretability, worked better than simple forecasting based on historical flight mapping algorithm only on 70% of the network</li>
                                <li>Captured the impact of capacity changes, competition flight positioning, seasonality, current booked position, Net Days Out (NDO), holidays & breaks on demand forecasting</li>
                                <li>The aim was to predict the number of passengers that will book a travel ticket in the remaining days to departure of a flight for next 90 days of departures</li>

                                <li>This led to Q-o-Q 5−7% improvement in RASK (Revenue/Available Seat KMs) and expected Y-o-Y improvement of approximately 5%</li>
