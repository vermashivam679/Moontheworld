                            In a fast-moving field like data science, it is critical to stay abreast of recent developments. The accelarated MDS program from UBC is enabling me to play an instrumental role in driving innovative data-science based initiatives in the real world and apply state-of-the-art techniques in data analysis.<br><br>

                            I come from a small city in India called Kanpur. Being an average student at school, studying from premiere engineering institutes like IITs was a big dream just like for 468,240 other students who appeared in IITJEE 2011. Passing the test required Herculean effort but the reward was a dream come true when I got a chance to study at IIT Delhi by being in the top 0.7% students.<br><br>

                            I attended various inter-departmental courses in subjects of my interest such as Mathematics, Computer Science, Finance, Economics and Psychology. Apart from my academic curriculum, I was an active member of Training & Placement Cell(TnP), Textile Engineering Society (TES), Student Mentorship Program(SMP) & National Service Scheme(NSS).
